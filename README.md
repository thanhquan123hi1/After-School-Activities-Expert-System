# After School Activities Expert System

This is a simple expert system written in Python that recommends after-school activities based on user input.

## How it works

The system asks the user a series of questions about their current state, including:

*   Available free time
*   Mood
*   Homework status
*   Personality type
*   Current weather
*   Budget
*   Preferred type of place

Based on the user's answers, the system provides a personalized recommendation for an after-school activity.

## How to use

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Run the script from your terminal:

`python After_School_Activities_Expert_System.py`

3.  Answer the questions as they are prompted.

## Example

What is your current mood? (1.Happy / 2.Sad / 3.Tired): **1**
Do you have homework? (1.Yes / 2.No): **2**
...

Based on your answers, the system will print a recommendation.
